とりあえずアメリカライブ、サクッと決めない？","They say, ""The sooner the better,"" so you know,

It's more efficient to get rich quick and go for something big."
"Idolchr_0202_A_01_00_025(0)","Ｐ","それもひとつの手段かもしれないな。
とはいえ、ルミナスは始動したばかりだ","That might be one way to go.

活動を進めていきたいと思ってる","While identifying the goodness of the unit,
I'd like to move forward with our activities."

プロデューサーのお手本って感じだね","...... Well, it's a reasonable opinion, I guess,
It's like a role model for producers."
"Idolchr_0202_A_01_00_033(0)","杏","アメリカ帰りって聞いたから、
チャレンジ大好きなタイプかと思ったけど……","I heard he was going back to the U.S,

これからもお互いに気楽にやっていこう～","For now, let's leave the big stuff aside,

杏がいつも使っている場所と違うでしょ？","You see, Luminous is a lesson place,
It's not the same place that Anzu usually use, is it?"
"Idolchr_0202_A_02_00_009(0)","杏","だから、迷子になっちゃって～。ちょうどいい所に
公園があったから、ひと休みしてたんだ","So, I got lost - in the right place.
There was a park, so we took a break."

It's energy to get to the lesson hall."

思ってくれる人、きっとプロデューサーくらいだよ","But I guess I'm kinda glad...like that.

杏のことを評価してくれたよね","Well, producers are kind of a jerk,
You appreciated the apricot."
"Idolchr_0202_A_12_00_016(0)","杏","でも、そもそも杏をルミナスに選んだくらいだし、
プロデューサーも相当な目利きだったってことか～","But I even chose Anzu as luminous in the first place,

プロデューサーに見つかってたなぁ","But no matter where the apricot is skipping, it will always be there.
I wish the producer had found me."

既にちょっと懐かしいねー","It wasn't that long ago,
I miss it a little already!"

"Idolchr_0202_A_12_00_024(0)","Ｐ","いや、最近はアメリカよりも目先のことに
集中してるみたいだったから","No, these days it's more immediate than the US.
She seemed so focused."
"Idolchr_0202_A_12_00_025(0)","杏","そうだねー。なんとなく、
このままやっていけば大丈夫かなって","Yes - sort of,
I thought if I just keep doing this, I'll be fine."

っていうのは、期待できないけどね","Great success in the U.S. right now!
I'm not sure I'd expect that to be the case, though."

もう少し付き合ってあげてもいいかなー","Well, if it was with a producer,
I don't know if I can keep you company a little longer."

杏をアメリカで大成功させるために頑張るよ","Okay, well, me too,
I'll do my best to make Anzu a big success in the US."

持ってるでしょ？","Producers, too, dream big dreams that are different from Anzu.
You have it, don't you?"
"Idolchr_0202_A_12_00_031(0)","杏","杏もアメリカ大成功の夢があるし。
刺激し合える、いい感じの関係だと思うよ","Anzu also has dreams of great success in the US.
I think we inspire each other, it's a good kind of relationship."

ビッグチャンスも引き寄せられるって気がするんだ","If two such people challenge each other, one day
I feel like I can attract big opportunities."
"Idolchr_0202_A_12_00_033(0)","杏","たぶん、プロデューサーは、杏にとって
普通のプロデューサーじゃないから","Perhaps the producer, for apricot
I'm not a regular producer."
